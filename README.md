These are the Mathematica code I developed for my full year theoretical physics project at Queen Mary. 

The topic of the project is on bootstrapping superstring amplitudes from the field theory limit. In this project, we showed how to construct moduli-space integrands for one-loop superstring amplitudes from the knowledge of 10D field-theory loop integrands in the Bern–Carrasco–Johansson (BCJ) form. The bootstrap method has two steps: 1) Write an ansatz for the superstring integrand in the chiral-splitting representation 2) Use monodromy relations to map the unknown coefficients in the ansatz to the corresponding known BCJ numerators in the field theory limit. This method relies on ambitwistor string theory and the Cachazo-He-Yuan (CHY) formula, which enable us to write field theory amplitudes as integrals over moduli space of the nodal sphere. We had successfully shown how to bootstrap the five-point, six-point and seven-point superstring integrands at one-loop. We are currently writing up a paper that is expected for publication in mid-2024.
